Our team previously fit a tabular model to predict 30-day unplanned readmission risk for congestive heart failure patients. The tabular model often misclassifies patients. We are now fitting a concept bottleneck model (CBM) to understand when the readmission model will misclassify patients. For the CBM, Y=1 means the patient was correctly classified and Y=0 means the patient was misclassified by the existing tabular model. Specifically, the goal is to construct a CBM that extract {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts from the discharge summary to predict misclassifications.

The top words most associated with model misclassifications have been estimated using a simple logistic regression model with tf-idf features. Based on the top words, come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question, e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing stomach pain?". Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad.

Words with top coefficients:

{top_features_df}

Summarize at the end with a JSON output with the following format:
{"concepts":
  [
      {
          "concept": "<CANDIDATE META CONCEPT>",
          "words": <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF THIS CONCEPT>
      },
      ...
  ],
}

Example:
{"concepts":
  [
      {
          "concept": "Does the note mention the patient having a history of pneumonia?",
          "words": "pneumonia"
      },
      {
          "concept": "Does the note mention the patient being uninsured?",
          "words": "uninsured, insurance"
      },
      ...
  ]
}

Ensure your answer contains {num_meta_concepts} concepts. Your answer:
