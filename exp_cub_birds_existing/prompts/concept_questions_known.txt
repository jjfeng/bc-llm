I will give you a series of questions about the bird in the image. Your task is answer each question with a probability from 0 to 1, which will help us distinguish the type of bird in the image. If the question asks about a bird feature that is obscured (e.g. "does the image depict a bird with black feet?"), reason about the bird you see and then provide your best guess (you may also use a probability if you are unsure). Summarize the response with a JSON that includes your answer to all of the questions, whenever the answer is nonzero (i.e. the answers should be provided in a format). Questions:
{prompt_questions}

Output your answer in the following format:
{
    "reasoning": "<DISCUSS REASONING HERE>",
    "extractions": [
        {
            "question": "<QUESTION_NUMBER>",
            "reasoning": "<REASONING>",
            "answer": <EXTRACTED VALUE FROM 0 to 1>,
        },
        ...
    ]  
}
Example:
{
    "reasoning": "The bird has attributes listed in question 1. The bird's feet are obscured, so I will output a probability for question 2.",
    "extractions":
    [
        {
            "question": 1,
            "reasoning": "This bird has this attribute.",
            "answer": 1
        },
        {
            "question": 2,
            "reasoning": "The feet are obscured so there is a small chance this bird is... So I will fill in 0.1.",
            "answer": 0.1
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Answer all the questions in order, and do not answer with anything else besides valid JSON. Your answer:
