We are fitting a concept bottleneck model for classifying the species of a bird based on the attributes of the bird in its image. The possible bird classes are: [[CLASS_OPTIONS]]. The goal is to come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts to extract from the images to maximize the accuracy of the concept bottleneck model. A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}

We are planning to add one of the following candidate meta-concepts to the concept bottleneck model:
{candidate_list}

Assign a prior probability for each of the candidate meta-concepts. To help come up with a prior probability, we have used an LLM to summarize each image and fit a bag-of-words model on the summaries to predict the residuals. These are the top features in the residual model, in descending order of importance:

{top_features_df}

Note if two candidate meta-concepts are the same, they should be assigned the same prior probability.

Summarize all the candidate meta-concepts with non-zero prior probabilities at the end with a valid JSON, formatted as follows:
{
    "candidate_priors": [
        {
            "candidate_id": <CANDIDATE_ID>,
            "reasoning": <REASONING (optional)>,
            "prior": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>
        },
        ...
    ]
}
Example:
{
    "candidate_priors": [
        {
            "candidate_id": 0,
            "reasoning": "This candidate is very likely because...",
            "prior": 0.4
        },
        {
            "candidate_id": 1,
            "reasoning": "This candidate is slightly less likely because...",
            "prior": 0.3
        },
        ...
    ]
}
