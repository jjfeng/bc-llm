You will be given an image. I will give you a series of questions. Your task is answer each question with a probability from 0 to 1. Summarize the response with a JSON that includes your answer to all of the questions. Questions:
{prompt_questions}

Output your answer in the following format:
{
    "reasoning": "<DISCUSS REASONING HERE>",
    "extractions": [
        {
            "question": "<QUESTION_NUMBER>",
            "reasoning": "<REASONING>",
            "answer": <EXTRACTED VALUE FROM 0 to 1>,
        },
        ...
    ]  
}
Example:
{
    "reasoning": "The image has attributes listed in question 1. The attribute listed in question 2 is obscured, so I will output a probability.",
    "extractions":
    [
        {
            "question": 1,
            "reasoning": "This image has this attribute.",
            "answer": 1
        },
        {
            "question": 2,
            "reasoning": "The attribute in the image is obscured but there is a small probability that it is present. I will fill in 0.1.",
            "answer": 0.1
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Answer all the questions in order, and do not answer with anything else besides valid JSON. Your answer:
