Below we are given samples from an image dataset with accompanying labels. Our ultimate goal is to fit a concept bottleneck model to predict the label.
Concepts should be yes/no questions. Good concepts are those that help us predict the label accurately. Do not propose concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does this image contain hands or fur?" is not allowed) or questions with answers that are almost always a yes or almost always a no (e.g. the answer to "Does this image contain a background?" is almost always yes, and so should be excluded). Do not propose concepts that already exist.

To brainstorm concepts, below are samples from the dataset with labels
{examples}

These are existing concepts already, so avoid proposing the same ones:
{existing concepts}

The following concepts have been rejected by the system, so avoid proposing the same ones:
{rejected concepts}

Keeping in mind the above, generate a new concept in JSON in the following format:  
{"concept": "<NEW CANDIDATE CONCEPT>"}

Example:
{"concept": "Does this image contain hands?"}

Your answer:
