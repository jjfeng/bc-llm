We are fitting a concept bottleneck model for classifying the species of a bird based on the attributes of the bird in its image. The possible bird classes are: [[CLASS_OPTIONS]]. The goal is to come up with {num_concepts} meta-concepts to extract from the images to maximize the accuracy of the concept bottleneck model. A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}

To come up with candidates for the {num_concepts}th meta-concept, I have done the following: I first fit a CBM on the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts. Then to figure out how to improve this {num_concepts_fixed}-concept CBM, I first asked an LLM to extract a list of attributes that are present in each image, and then fit a linear regression model on the extracted attributes to predict the residuals of the {num_concepts_fixed}-concept CBM. These are the top extracted attributes in the resulting residual model, in descending order of importance:

{top_features_df}

To interpret this residual model, a general rule of thumb is that an extracted attribute with a large positive coefficient means that the outcome is positively associated with the attribute being in the image, and an extracted attribute with a negative coefficient means that the outcome is negatively associated with the attribute being in the image.

Given the residual model, create cohesive candidates for the {num_concepts}th meta-concept. Be systematic by working through ALL {num_attributes} attributes in the residual model one by one, starting from the most to the least predictive. For each attribute, check if it matches an existing meta-concept or create a new candidate meta-concept. All attributes should correspond to at least one candidate. Work down the list, iterating through each attribute. Clearly state each candidate meta-concept as a yes/no question.

Suggestions for generating candidate meta-concepts: Do not propose meta-concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does this bird have blue wings or red feet?" is not allowed) or questions with answers that are almost always a yes (e.g. the answer to "Does this bird have wings?" is almost always yes, and so should be excluded). Do not propose meta-concepts where you would expect over 95% agreement or disagreement with the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts (e.g. "Does bird have a red head?" overlaps too much with "Does the bird have a cardinal head?").

Output at least 6 candidate concepts in the following JSON format:
{
    "reasoning": "<DISCUSS REASONING FOR WHICH CONCEPTS TO INCLUDE>",
    "concepts": [
        {"concept": "<CANDIDATE META CONCEPT>", "words": <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF THIS CONCEPT>},
        ...
    ]
}
Here are example concept dictionaries:
[
    {"concept": "Does the bird in the image have blue feathers?", "words": "blue feathers, blue plumage"},
    {"concept": "Does the bird in the image have a curved beak?", "words": "curved beak"},
    ...
]
