The goal is to come up with a concept bottleneck model that only extracts {num_concepts} meta-concepts to describe attributes in an image to predict some outcome Y with maximum accuracy. A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}

We are planning to add one of the following candidate meta-concepts to the concept bottleneck model to predict Y:
{candidate_list}

Assign a prior probability for each of the candidate meta-concepts. To help come up with a prior probability, we have used an LLM to summarize each image and fit a bag-of-words model on the summaries to predict the residuals. These are the top features in the residual model, in descending order of importance:

{top_features_df}

Note if two candidate meta-concepts are the same, they should be assigned the same prior probability.

Summarize all the candidate meta-concepts with non-zero prior probabilities at the end with a valid JSON, formatted as follows:
{
    "0": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>,
    "1": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>,
    ...
}
Example:
{
    "0": 0.1,
    "1": 0.4,
    ...
}
