I will give you a series of questions about the list of images. For each image, your task is answer each question with a probability from 0 to 1. If the question asks about a feature that is obscured (e.g. "does the image depict a bird with black feet?"), reason about what you see and then provide your best guess in terms of a probability. Summarize the response with a JSON that includes your answer to all of the questions, whenever the answer is nonzero (i.e. the answers should be provided in a format). Answer in a sparse format, providing answers to only attributes whose values are nonzero.

            "reasoning": "The first image does not have attributes listed in questions 2,5... so I will omit those in the final JSON. The remaining questions I will fill with ones or probabilities."

                },
                {
                    "question": 3,
                    "reasoning": "The feet are obscured so there is a small chance this bird is... So I will fill in 0.1.",
                    "answer": 0.1
                },
                {
                    "question": 4,
                    "reasoning": "The belly is obscured but this bird is either a ... or a ..., so I will fill in 0.5 for question...",
                    "answer": 0.5
                },
                ...
            ]
