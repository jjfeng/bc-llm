We are fitting a concept bottleneck model for predicting some outcome Y based on image attributes. The goal is to come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts to extract from the images to maximize the accuracy of the concept bottleneck model.

Based on the top words most associated with the outcome Y estimated using a simple logistic regression model with tf-idf features, come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question, e.g. Does this image contain hands? The concept should be defined in a way that is associated with the outcome Y, so for words that typically correspond to a "yes" answer for the question should have large positive coefficients, whereas words that typically correspond to a "no" answer should have very negative coefficients. You can also propose meta-concepts that only correspond to a single word. Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad. Meta-concepts should be questions about the attributes in an image.

Words with top coefficients (by absolute value):

{top_features_df}

Output {num_meta_concepts} concepts in the following JSON format:
{
    "reasoning": "<DISCUSS REASONING FOR WHICH CONCEPTS TO INCLUDE>",
    "concepts": [
        {"concept": "<CANDIDATE META CONCEPT>", "words": <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF THIS CONCEPT>},
        ...
    ]
}
Here is an example:
{
    "reasoning": "There are many keyphrases that are related to each other so I will group some together.",
    "concepts": [
        {"concept": "Does the image contain hands?", "words": "hands, palms"},
        {"concept": "Does the image contain fur?", "words": "fur, hair"},
        ...
    ]
}
