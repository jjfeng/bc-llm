The goal is to come up with a concept bottleneck model that only extracts {num_concepts} meta-concepts from patient notes from the electronic health record to predict some outcome Y with maximum accuracy. A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}
So far, we've fit a concept bottleneck model to predict Y using only the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts.
To brainstorm a {num_concepts}th meta-concept that will most improve the performance of the concept bottleneck model, here are some notes that have predicted probabilities from the existing {num_concepts_fixed}-concept bottleneck model that disagree the most with their true labels. Maybe you can help find a consistent pattern for refining the predicted probabilities, such that the existence of a meta-concept should increase the predicted probability and its absence should decrease the predicted probability?

{pairs}

Given this information, brainstorm three or more new candidate meta-concepts, clearly stated as a yes/no question. Do not suggest meta-concepts that already exist.

Meta-concepts are yes/no questions. Meta-concepts should be cohesive, not the conjunction of two separate concepts.

Answer with a list of {num_meta_concepts} JSONs, one per line:
{<QUESTION 1>: <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF QUESTION 1>}
{<QUESTION 2>: <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF QUESTION 2>}
...
{<QUESTION {num_meta_concepts}>: <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF QUESTION {num_meta_concepts}>}

Example answer:
{"Does the note mention the patient having a history of pneumonia?": "pneumonia"}
{"Does the note mention the patient being uninsured?": "uninsured, insurance"}

Final answer:
