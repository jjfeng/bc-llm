We are fitting a concept bottleneck model for predicting some outcome Y based on clinical text. The goal is to come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts to extract from the text to maximize the accuracy of the concept bottleneck model.

Based on the top words most associated with the outcome Y estimated using a simple logistic regression model with tf-idf features, come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question, e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing stomach pain?". The concept should be defined in a way that is associated with the outcome Y, so for words that typically correspond to a "yes" answer for the question should have large positive coefficients, whereas words that typically correspond to a "no" answer should have very negative coefficients. You can also propose meta-concepts that only correspond to a single word. Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad.

Words with top coefficients:

{top_features_df}

Summarize at the end with a JSON output with the following format:
{"concepts":
  [
      {
          "concept": "<CANDIDATE META CONCEPT>",
          "words": <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF THIS CONCEPT>
      },
      ...
  ],
}

Example:
{"concepts":
  [
      {
          "concept": "Does the note mention the patient having a history of pneumonia?",
          "words": "pneumonia"
      },
      {
          "concept": "Does the note mention the patient being uninsured?",
          "words": "uninsured, insurance"
      },
      ...
  ]
}

Ensure your answer contains {num_meta_concepts} concepts. Your answer:
