The goal is to come up with a concept bottleneck model that only extracts {num_concepts} meta-concepts from patient notes from the electronic health record to predict some outcome Y with maximum accuracy. A meta-concept is a binary feature extractor defined by a yes/no question. We have {num_concepts_fixed} meta-concepts so far:
{meta_concepts}
So far, we've fit a concept bottleneck model to predict Y using only the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts.

We are planning to add one of the following candidate meta-concepts to the concept bottleneck model to predict Y:
{candidate_list}

Assign a prior probability for each of the candidate meta-concepts. To help come up with a prior probability, here are two pieces of information:

1. We have used an LLM to summarize each note and fit a bag-of-words model on the summaries to predict the residuals. These are the top features in the residual model, in descending order of importance:

{top_features_df}

2. Here are some notes that have predicted probabilities from the existing {num_concepts_fixed}-concept bottleneck model that disagree the most with their true labels.

{pairs}

Note if two candidate meta-concepts are the same, they should be assigned the same prior probability.

Summarize the assigned prior probability for each candidate meta-concept at the end with a JSON formatted as follows:
{
    "0": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>,
    "1": <PRIOR_PROBABILITY>,
    ...
}
Example:
{
    "0": 0.1,
    "1": 0.4,
    ...
}
