Here is a pre-operative note written by an anesthesiologist prior to a patient's surgery:
"{note}"
List factors that increase or decrease readmission risk in the following format. For each descriptor, list multiple descriptors that mean the same thing or are generalizations of the descriptor (i.e. likely to be seen in other patients as well). Descriptors, synonyms, and generalizations should be succinct and no more than three words.
Format:
{"1": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR1_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
{"2": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR2_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
...
Example:
{"1": "Nicotine dependence, Substance dependence, Substance use disorder"}
{"2": "Variable EF, CHF Exacerbation"}
{"3": "Lexapro initiation, Mental Health Plan, Discharge instructions"}
