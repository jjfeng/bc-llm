Here is a pre-operative note written by an anesthesiologist prior to a patient's surgery:
"{note}"
List characteristics that this patient has or characteristics of the planned procedure that may increase or decrease AKI risk in the following format. For each descriptor, list multiple descriptors that mean the same thing or are generalizations of the descriptor (i.e. likely to be seen in other patients as well). Descriptors, synonyms, and generalizations should be succinct and no more than three words. Include any scores/results from screening exams, such as "high STOPBANG score" or "high risk of sleep apnea".
Format:
{"1": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR1_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
{"2": "<STRING_OF_DESCRIPTOR2_AND_SYNONYMS_AND_GENERALIZATIONS>"}
...
Example:
{"1": "Nicotine dependence, Substance dependence, Substance use disorder"}
{"2": "Cardiopulmonary bypass"}
