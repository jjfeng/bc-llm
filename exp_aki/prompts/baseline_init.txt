We are fitting a concept bottleneck model to predict AKI risk for patients undergoing anestheia during surgery. The goal is to come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts to extract from the pre-operative notes that maximize the accuracy of the concept bottleneck model.

The top words most associated with AKI risk was estimated using a simple logistic regression model with tf-idf features. Based on the top words, come up with {num_meta_concepts} meta-concepts. A meta-concept has to be defined in terms of a yes/no question, e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing stomach pain?". Pick meta-concepts that are as specific as possible, without being too broad.

Suggestions for generating candidate meta-concepts: Do not propose meta-concepts that are simply a union of two different concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing stomach pain or being female?" is not allowed), questions with answers that are almost always a yes (e.g. the answer to "Does the note mention this patient being sick?" is almost always yes), or questions where the yes/no options are not clearly defined (e.g. "Does the note mention this patient experiencing difficulty?" is not clearly defined because difficulty may mean financial difficulty, physical difficulties, etc). Do not propose meta-concepts where you would expect over 95% agreement or disagreement with the {num_concepts_fixed} existing meta-concepts (e.g. "Does the note mention the patient having high blood pressure?" overlaps too much with "Does the note mention the patient having hypertension?").

Answer with a list of {num_meta_concepts} JSONs, one per line:
{<QUESTION 1>: <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF QUESTION 1>}
{<QUESTION 2>: <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF QUESTION 2>}
...
{<QUESTION {num_meta_concepts}>: <COMMA-SEPARATED WORDS THAT ARE CLOSE SYNONYMS OR ANTONYMS OF QUESTION {num_meta_concepts}>}

Example answer:
{"Does the note mention the patient having a history of pneumonia?": "pneumonia"}
{"Does the note mention the patient being uninsured?": "uninsured, insurance"}

Final answer:
